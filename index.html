          <p class="answer">
            The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
            are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on
            each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to
            tell the difference.

          <p class="answer">
            Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
            portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
            their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!

          <p class="answer">
            The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
            Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so
            it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
            channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our
            Discord server here.
